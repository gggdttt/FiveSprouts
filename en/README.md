##ã€€Preface

This booklet is a birthday present for the 21st birthday of [@JiananAlvin](https://github.com/JiananAlvin), one of my best friends at DTU. I have considered carefully of which kind of present could help you best since about 2 months ago, and I don't know when the idea flashed in my mind -- write a booklet about how to start to learn <u>Computer Science</u>! You will completely start an exciting travel on CS 'mainland' next semester. Hence, I want to convey to you  what I hope I could/should know 5 years ago. 

I will organize all these points to 5 chapters(called as Sprout).  I do recommend you to try every code/step by your hand because coding is more or less experience-driving. You could only totally understand it when you are using it in a real developing environment.

I hope all the skills and tools mentioned could help you to save more time and find the interest of coding.

By the way, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
