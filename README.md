##ã€€Preface

This booklet is a birthday present for the 21st birthday of [@JiananAlvin](https://github.com/JiananAlvin), one of my best friends at DTU. I have considered carefully of which kind of presents could help you best since about 2 months ago and I don't know when the idea flashed in my mind -- write a booklet about how to start to learn <u>Computer Science</u>! You will completely start an exciting travel on CS 'mainland' next semester. Hence, what I want to convey to you is what I hope I could know 5 years ago from my current perspective. 

I will organize all these points to 5 chapters.  I do recommend you to try every code/step by your hand because coding is experience-driving. I try to show you my experience but if you do not repeat that you would not remember to check it when you are using it in a real developing environment.

I hope all the skills and tools mentioned could help you to save more time and find the interest of coding.
