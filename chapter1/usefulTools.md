I still remember that when I was a complete rookie, I did not know how to organize my files and my developing tools.   It is a common problem -- even some  experienced software engineers I have met also have similar issues about organizing themselves(not only codes but also projects). 

Hence, in the first 'Sprout' I want to share with you is the tools which could obviously improve your working feeling of being an software engineer.
